Project Introduction

The application that we are focusing on is a Dynamic advertisement delivery system in combination with a face-based authentication system. The main actuator of the project is a dynamic content deliverer which delivers personalized content to the user based on the facial, demographic and sentiment analysis of the userâ€™s face. Amazon Rekognition API is a chief operator in this process, it performs all the aforementioned analysis on the captured user images and produces a result which can be used to make a decision on which advertisement to display. The decisioning logic decides which advertisement to display based on the results produced by Rekognition API. The data produced by Rekognition API is also stored for analytics purposes and to improve accuracy of future decisions based on the demographic data.

The image data is captured from a video feed, still frames are acquired from this video feed and as mentioned above, the image is analyzed using Amazon Rekognition API to produce results. This project makes use of various Amazon cloud services like S3, DynamoDB, Lambda.
